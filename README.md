## Hello everyone, first I would like to present a hobby that consists of creating web pages, and this time I created a web workshop on herbal vaporizers where there is a whole modern page with a dark theme. A complete workshop with interactive navbar and a search bar that can search for all items, just using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below I will show some images from the website with explanations. Some pics Bellow üì∏:

## 1- Search-Box üîç : When clicking on the search bar, the user must type the product name and will then be redirected to the product page. It also has a history of previous searches.

## In addition to the simple and clear code that is easy to read and understand.
